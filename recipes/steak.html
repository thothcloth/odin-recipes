        <p>It's steak.  Medium rare and delicious.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingedients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
            <li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
            <li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
            <li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
